        <title>YACS pgAdmin with Nginx Caching</title>
        <description>

YACS uses a postgres database to store all school, department, course, and section data. Last month, I dockerized PgAdmin to...

        <description>
          
          Hi everyone, I would like to tell you about my background as a prologue before my next blog posts of the semester. I have been running various flavors of the Linux kernel on my servers since 16 years old. Since 16, my creation of GradeSmart gave me a great canvas...

        <description>
          
          YACS Android App Update During the middle of November, I created an early concept design of the YACS courses view the way I envisioned it, using my ancient Wacom Graphire 2 tablet. I showed it to the group and the working-concept was well received by the YACS team. Soon after...

        <title>In-Depth Nginx</title>
        <description>
          
          I am pleased to announce that YACS will soon run using Nginx with Docker. Docker makes the installation of Nginx easy by simply specifying the Nginx image name in the “docker-compose.yml” file. The switch from Apache to Nginx induces great performance improvements. This is because Nginx caches static files. In...

        <description>
          
          Yesterday, I canceled my Comcast triple play subscription. In its place, I bought a Amazon Fire TV stick and subscribed to Sony’s PS Vue. I started to enjoy a life almost entirely free from the grips of Comcast. After reading a lot of reviews online, I bought the Arris SB6190...
